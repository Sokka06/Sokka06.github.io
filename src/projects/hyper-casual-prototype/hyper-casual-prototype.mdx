**A simple hyper-casual prototype game for Android devices I made for my thesis.**

The player's objective is to succesfully maneuver their vehicle to the finish line on a randomly generated track.

The vehicle did not use any real physics or a Rigidbody.
Instead, it used Kinematic Character Controller asset from Unity asset store, which is usually used for humanoid characters.
One of the reasons to use KCC instead of Rigidbody physics was to have a very tight control over the vehicle's movement.

One downside of using KCC was that it could only use a single Capsule or Sphere collider for it's collisions. In this case this was fine as the game did not require accurate collisions or behaviour.

Sadly, I did not have enough time to make a procedural track generator as I had very limited time to finish my thesis.
