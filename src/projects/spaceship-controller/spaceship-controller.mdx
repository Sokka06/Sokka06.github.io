**Simple 2D spaceship controller using Rigidbodies.**

Player's objective in the game is to extract subjects and get to the end of the level without taking too much damage to their hull or dome. Hits to the dome are one hit kills when colliding with enough force, whereas the hull can take hits until it's health reaches zero.

Player controls the spaceship's thrusters by pressing down on the screen.

Player can press down on both sides of the screen to go straight upwards or rotate the ship by pressing down on one side of the screen.

Spaceship's legs use similar Raycast force springs as what I used for my vehicle controller. The visual part of legs use Unity's 2D IK package to position them to where the springs make contact with ground.

I also used a similar component based approach for this as I did with my vehicle controller.
