			"An arcadish Boat Controller and AI Steering for a mobile game. Dynamic Water Physics 2 asset by NWH Coding is used for water buoyancy physics.</p>",
			"<p>The AI uses Behavior Designer asset made by Opsive along with custom actions to steer the boat. The first action tries to drive the boat along a given racing line and the second action tries to steer away from dynamic objects.</p>",
			"<p>Race line action finds the closest point on the racing line and a future point based on current speed and look-ahead time. These two points are used to sample the line to get a world position and tangent direction. At the moment I calculate a middle point from current and future points as well as a direction between current and future points tangent direction and use them to calculate the direction AI should steer towards.</p>",
			"<p>Avoidance action scans for dynamic objects in the direction the boat is currently traveling. All detected dynamic objects are iterated through to calculate a direction away from them. Before this direction is used to influence the current steer direction, it is scaled by a few different factors, e.g. how far away the object is from the boat, is the boat going towards it, and is it moving in the same direction and at the same speed.</p>",
			"<p>Every action also has a Weight variable, which can be used to adjust how much that action will influence the AI's target direction and speed overall.</p>",
			"<p>The boat controller uses a similar component-based approach to control its Rigidbody as two previous projects.</p>"
